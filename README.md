# php-login
Web app built using PHP and MySQL.  It has login, signup, a comment board with edit and delete buttons, basic authentication checking and basic SQL injection protection.  I have recently added some styling with Bootstrap.

These files can be used in a PHP compatible web server like xampp.  Create a database called "php_login_db" in PhpMyAdmin and import php_login_db.sql.
