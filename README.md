# php-login
Web app built using PHP and MySQL.  It has login, signup, a comment board with edit and delete buttons, basic authentication checking and basic SQL injection protection.  It currently has minimal styling.  These files can be used in a PHP compatible web server like xampp.  I will need to make database seed data.
